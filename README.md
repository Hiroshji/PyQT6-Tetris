# PyQT6 - Tetris
This is a Tetris game built using PyQt6. 
(Current Version v1.2)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Bug Fixes for v1.2
> **Improved Collision and Locking:** Remade collision checks to prevent overlapping or freezing, making sure the pieces lock in place correctly when reaching the bottom or other blocks, with immediate board updates and line clearing.
>
> *(this unironically made a similar bug where the pieces duplicates)*
>
> **Fixed Pieces falling off screen:** The borders where to long vertically so it would fall off screen.
